# The SvelteKit Stack For Enterprise

Time is money and setting up a project can be a lot when you could be focusing on the business logic ‚Äî now you can using this powerful SvelteKit enterprise grade template.

Tap into your true potential and you're going to be laughing "Ha Ha! Business" out loud in no time to the bank.

## Stack

Every part of the SvelteKit stack for enterprise is optimized to go blazingly fast to please investors and shareholders alike using:

- [Prisma](https://www.prisma.io/) for the database
- [Lucia](https://lucia-auth.com/) for authentication
- [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/) for styling
- [Skeleton UI](https://www.skeleton.dev/) for the UI components
- Automatic class sorting for Tailwind

You can change how everything works from your database to authentication **if you read their documentation** ‚Äî for example by default Prisma uses [SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/index.html) because it requires no setup but it's trivial to change it to use any other SQL database if you want.

## Using The Template

You can start a new project by pressing "Use this template" inside GitHub which copies the project over with a clean Git history.

## Using Degit

You can use `degit` to download the project if you don't want to create a new repository, or if you're not using GitHub which also gives you a clean slate to start from.

```
npx degit joysofcode/enterprise-stack
```

## Setup

üì¶Ô∏è Install the project dependencies.

```bash
npm i
```

‚öôÔ∏è Rename `.env.example` to `.env` and set your environment variables inside.

```shell
DATABASE_URL="file:./dev.db"
```

üìú Create the database and generate the Prisma client from your Prisma schema.

```bash
npx prisma db push
```

This is great for trying things out but you can use [Prisma migrate](https://www.prisma.io/docs/concepts/components/prisma-migrate) for production.

You can change the database schema inside `prisma/schema.prisma` and run `npx prisma studio` to look at your database.

üíøÔ∏è Run the development server.

```bash
npm run dev
```

## Deploying

You can pick a SvelteKit adapter you want and deploy this to anywhere. If you don't have a full-stack hosting solution you can use a serverless SQL database provider and host your frontend somewhere else.

```bash
npm run build
```

You can also preview the build.

```bash
npm run preview
```
